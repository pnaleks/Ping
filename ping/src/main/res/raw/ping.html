<h2>DESCRIPTION<a name="lbAD">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>
<b>ping</b> uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of
"pad" bytes used to fill out the packet.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS<a name="lbAE">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<dl compact="compact">
    <dt><b>-a</b></dt><dd>Audible ping.</dd>
    <dt><b>-A</b></dt><dd>Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one
(or more, if preload is set) unanswered probes present in the network. Minimal interval is 200msec for not super-user. On
networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode.</dd>
    <dt><b>-b</b></dt><dd>Allow pinging a broadcast address.</dd>
    <dt><b>-B</b></dt><dd>Do not allow <b>ping</b> to change source address of probes.
The address is bound to one selected when <b>ping</b> starts.</dd>
    <dt><b>-c </b><i>count</i><b></b></dt><dd>Stop after sending <i>count</i> ECHO_REQUEST packets. With
<i>deadline</i> option, <b>ping</b> waits for <i>count</i> ECHO_REPLY packets, until the timeout expires.</dd>
    <dt><b>-d</b></dt><dd>Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.
Essentially, this socket option is not used by Linux kernel.</dd>
    <dt><b>-F </b><i>flow label</i><b></b></dt><dd>Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo request packets.
(Only <b>ping6</b>). If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow label.</dd>
    <dt><b>-f</b></dt><dd>Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed,
while for ever ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
If interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per
second, whichever is more. Only the super-user may use this option with zero interval.</dd>
    <dt><b>-i </b><i>interval</i><b></b></dt><dd>Wait <i>interval</i> seconds between sending each packet.
The default is to wait for one second between each packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set
interval to values less 0.2 seconds.</dd>
    <dt><b>-I </b><i>interface address</i><b></b></dt><dd>Set source address to specified interface address. Argument
may be numeric IP address or name of device. When pinging IPv6 link-local address this option is required.</dd>
    <dt><b>-l </b><i>preload</i><b></b></dt><dd>If <i>preload</i> is specified, <b>ping</b> sends that many packets not waiting
for reply. Only the super-user may select preload more than 3.</dd>
    <dt><b>-L</b></dt><dd>Suppress loopback of multicast packets.  This flag only applies if the ping destination is a
multicast address.</dd>
    <dt><b>-n</b></dt><dd>Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.</dd>
    <dt><b>-p </b><i>pattern</i><b></b></dt><dd>You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you send.
This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network. For example, <b>-p ff</b> will cause the sent packet
to be filled with all ones.</dd>
    <dt><b>-Q </b><i>tos</i><b></b></dt><dd>Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. <i>tos</i> can be either
decimal or hex number. Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as: 0 for reserved (currently being redefined as
congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and 5-7 for Precedence. Possible settings for Type of Service are: minimal cost:
0x02, reliability: 0x04, throughput: 0x08, low delay: 0x10.  Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. Possible
settings for special Precedence range from priority (0x20) to net control (0xe0). You must be root (CAP_NET_ADMIN capability)
to use Critical or higher precedence value.  You cannot set bit 0x01 (reserved) unless ECN has been enabled in the kernel.
In RFC2474, these fields has been redefined as 8-bit Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 of separate data
(ECN will be used, here), and bits 2-7 of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP).</dd>
    <dt><b>-q</b></dt><dd>Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.</dd>
    <dt><b>-R</b></dt><dd>Record route. (IPv4 only) Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays
the route buffer on returned packets. Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or
discard this option.</dd>
    <dt><b>-r</b></dt><dd>Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached interface. If the host is
not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned. This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it provided the option <b>-I</b> is also used.</dd>
    <dt><b>-s </b><i>packetsize</i><b></b></dt><dd>Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which
translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.</dd>
    <dt><b>-S </b><i>sndbuf</i><b></b></dt><dd>Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one
packet.</dd>
    <dt><b>-t </b><i>ttl</i><b></b></dt><dd>Set the IP Time to Live.</dd>
    <dt><b>-T </b><i>timestamp option</i><b></b></dt><dd>Set special IP timestamp options. <i>timestamp option</i> may be
either <i>tsonly</i> (only timestamps), <i>tsandaddr</i> (timestamps and addresses) or <i>tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3
[host4]]]</i> (timestamp prespecified hops).</dd>
    <dt><b>-M </b><i>hint</i><b></b></dt><dd>Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. <i>hint</i> may be either <i>do</i> (prohibit
fragmentation, even local one), <i>want</i> (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or <i>dont</i> (do
not set DF flag).</dd>
    <dt><b>-U</b></dt><dd>Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally <b>ping</b> prints network round trip
time, which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.</dd>
    <dt><b>-v</b></dt><dd>Verbose output.</dd>
    <dt><b>-V</b></dt><dd>Show version and exit.</dd>
    <dt><b>-w </b><i>deadline</i><b></b></dt><dd>Specify a timeout, in seconds, before <b>ping</b> exits regardless of how many
packets have been sent or received. In this case <b>ping</b> does not stop after <i>count</i> packet are sent, it waits either
for <i>deadline</i> expire or until <i>count</i> probes are answered or for some error notification from network.</dd>
    <dt><b>-W </b><i>timeout</i><b></b></dt><dd>Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only timeout in
absense of any responses, otherwise <b>ping</b> waits for two RTTs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
When using <b>ping</b> for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify that the local network
interface is up and running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be "pinged". Round-trip times and packet
loss statistics are computed. If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss calculation, although
the round trip time of these packets is used in calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers. When the
specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is
displayed. Shorter current statistics can be obtained without termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.</p>
<p>
If <b>ping</b> does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1. If a packet <i>count</i> and <i>deadline</i>
are both specified, and fewer than <i>count</i> packets are received by the time the <i>deadline</i> has arrived, it will also
exit with code 1. On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit
code to see if a host is alive or not.</p>
<p>
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management. Because of the load it can impose on the
network, it is unwise to use <b>ping</b> during normal operations or from automated scripts.</p>

<h2>ICMP PACKET DETAILS<a name="lbAF">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>
An IP header without options is 20 bytes. An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header
followed by an arbitrary amount of data. When a <i>packetsize</i> is given, this indicated the size of this extra piece of data
(the default is 56). Thus the amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes
more than the requested data space (the ICMP header).</p>
<p>
If the data space is at least of size of struct timeval <b>ping</b> uses the beginning bytes of this space to include a
timestamp which it uses in the computation of round trip times. If the data space is shorter, no round trip times are given.</p>

<h2>DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS<a name="lbAG">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>
<b>ping</b> will report duplicate and damaged packets. Duplicate packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions. Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign,
although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.</p>
<p>
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the <b>ping</b> packet's
path (in the network or in the hosts).</p>

<h2>TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS<a name="lbAH">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>
The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the data contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something that doesn't have sufficient "transitions", such as
all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It isn't necessarily enough to specify a data
pattern of all zeros (for example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link level, and
the relationship between what you type and what the controllers transmit can be complicated.</p>
<p>
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of testing to find it. If you are
lucky, you may manage to find a file that either can't be sent across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than
other similar length files. You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the <b>-p</b> option
of <b>ping</b>.</p>

<h2>TTL DETAILS<a name="lbAI">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>
The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through before being thrown
away. In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly one.</p>
<p>
The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for TCP packets should be set to 60, but many systems use smaller values
(4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).</p>
<p>
The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most Unix systems set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.
This is why you will find you can ``ping'' some hosts, but not reach them with <b>telnet</b>(1) or <b>ftp</b>(1).</p>
<p>
In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the packet it receives. When a remote system receives a ping packet, it can
do one of three things with the TTL field in its response:</p>
<ul compact="compact">
    <li>Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix systems did before the 4.3BSD Tahoe release. In this case the TTL value in
the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the round-trip path.</li>
    <li>Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley Unix systems do. In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be
255 minus the number of routers in the path <b>from</b> the remote system <b>to</b> the <b>ping</b>ing host.</li>
    <li>Set it to some other value. Some machines use the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for
example either 30 or 60. Others may use completely wild values.</li>
</ul>

<h2>BUGS<a name="lbAJ">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<ul compact="compact">
    <li>Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.</li>
    <li>The maximum IP header length is too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful. There's not much that
that can be done about this, however.</li>
    <li>Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the broadcast address should only be done under very
controlled conditions.</li>
</ul>
